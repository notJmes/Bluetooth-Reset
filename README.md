# Bluetooth Reset

This is a simple Android development project that I worked on. The outcome is a simple menu with a button to direct the user to the management of the Bluetooth package in the android settings. This application was used for me to quickly access it to force stop my Bluetooth, back then when my phone was faccing issues with it.
